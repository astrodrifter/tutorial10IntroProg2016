# *************************** Question/Activity 2 ******************************
# Please attempt question 5.13 from the link

# https://equella.rmit.edu.au/rmit/file/0dd40e51-d2e4-4c42-9953-78a8da7814a4/1/130124_1_001.pdf



# *************************** Question/Activity 3 ******************************
# Using 'while' loops instead of 'for' loops, attempt question 5.14 from the link
# below (login necessary):
# https://equella.rmit.edu.au/rmit/file/0dd40e51-d2e4-4c42-9953-78a8da7814a4/1/130124_1_001.pdf
# Hint: If you find 'while' loops challenging at first, use nested for loops and
#       refer to Yongli's 'Cheat sheet on for loops, nested loops and while loops'
#       email sent on 15 July 2016 to convert them to 'while' loops. 
# Hint 2: Optional: Consider making the comic strip based on the individual images
#         that you add to it. You will need to use lists for this.
# Write your code/answer immediately below:





# *************************** Question/Activity 4 ******************************
# Attempt question 5.16 from the link below (login necessary):
# https://equella.rmit.edu.au/rmit/file/0dd40e51-d2e4-4c42-9953-78a8da7814a4/1/130124_1_001.pdf
# Hint 1: Questions 5.21 and 5.25 are continuations of this exercise. Make 5.16
#         a general/reusable function that can be used to add a house to any image.
# Hint 2: There are no marks for the aesthetics; a roof, a wall and a single door
#         drawn using three addRect/addRectFilled calls would be adequate.
# Write your code/answer immediately below:
